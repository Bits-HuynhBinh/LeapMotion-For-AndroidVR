# AndroidLeapVRUnity
A Unity3d application made for Android VR (cardboard specifically) and Leap Motion.

As of 3/24/2017 there is no native solution for android vr and leap motion compatibility so as a work around visit https://github.com/levrn/gear-vr-leap-unity for this. The only disadvantage is having the leap motion usb tethered a computer.
